Front end developers at ThinkShout ensure that every website we ship has a gorgeous, accessible theme. Our front end developers take great pride in their craft and their tools.

###Qualifications:
- You have expert familiarity with Photoshop (slicing up PSDs).
- You have expertise in HTML5, CSS3, SASS/Compass and LESS.
- You understand mobile first responsive web design and don't understand why we haven't always been doing it this way.
- You have an interest in working with new, emergent front end technologies.
- You're a self-starter; you care about your development tools; you stay on top of new technologies and development best practices.
- You are familiar with HTML and CSS prototyping frameworks, such as Zurb's Foundation and Twitter's Bootstrap.
- You are passionate about how a user experiences a website.
- Ideally, you have a deep understanding of Drupal's theme layer and "PHP for Drupal."
- You're just as comfortable manipulating the DOM using JQuery as CSS. If Angular, Backbone, and/or Ember are your quiver, even better. They will be soon regardless if you join our team.

###Compensation Packages
- A competitive salary.
- Comprehensive benefits package including health insurance with dental, vision, and alternative care, a matching 401k, and a very generous 30 day flat PTO policy.
- Get paid to learn and go to conferences, such as DrupalCon, Dreamforce and the Nonprofit Technology Conference.
- A focus on work/life balance, including a flexible office hours policy.
