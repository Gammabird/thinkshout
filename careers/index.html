      <div class="large-7 columns large-centered">
        <p>At ThinkShout, we lead with technical excellence, innovation, and sustainable business practices. We focus on interesting projects that lead to open source contributions serving grassroots organizers and progressive causes. We are maintainers of many popular Drupal tools such as the MailChimp module, the Salesforce Integration Suite, and RedHen CRM. We’ve got our finger on the pulse of the Drupal community and we are contributing back daily with updates and new tools designed to make everyone’s development process easier.</p>
        <p>Our company vision boils down to a few basic things:
        <ul>
          <li>Invest in the most talented technologists, project managers and designers possible</li>
          <li>Work with clients committed to positive social change</li>
          <li>Don't compromise on tools, process, or quality</li>
          <li>Work hard, have fun, and give back</li>
          <li>Leave the job at office at the end of the day and enjoy living in beautiful Portland, Oregon</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We’re convinced that this is the recipe for success. It hasn’t failed us yet. </p>
        <p>Does this sound like the kind of work you can get behind? Are you you a good communicator? Committed to excellence? Do you care about these organizations as much as we do? Do you currently reside in or are willing to locate to beautiful Portland, Oregon? If so, we want to talk to you. </p>
