client: MicroMentor, a Mercy Corps project, was founded to connect aspiring entrepreneurs with mentors. It also provides them with a library of resources to help them grow their enterprises. MicroMentor needed to expand its membership and improve engagement through a fresh redesign. We worked to make their new site a place for dialogue that encouraged member involvement, streamlined the signup process, and showcased their successes. The result was a clean, responsive site that served as a discussion space for a large community of entrepreneurs.

      While MicroMentor didn’t need a rebrand, it did require a fresh look designed to appeal to a broader audience. MicroMentor had a very large library of written resources that they wanted to make easily accessible to the entrepreneurs in search of resources that would help their grow their businesses. It needed to be a place that would appeal to both entrepreneurs and mentors, and provide them with a forum for discussion.

      ThinkShout teamed up with a third party firm to develop a way to better accomplish MicroMentor’s purpose: to connect entrepreneurs with mentors and facilitate dialogue between them. We overhauled MicroMentor’s member sign-up system and created a brand new, gorgeous platform for networking that was both visually pleasing and easy to use.
