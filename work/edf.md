      We developed clickable wireframes that performed beautifully on a variety of mobile devices. Our mobile-first approach ensured that users could easily use the tool no matter how they chose to browse, thus giving the EDF’s primary audience a viable tool to use in the supermarket.

      After creating style tiles and a design guideline, we successfully handed it off to the internal development team and helped reintroduce the Seafood Selector to the world.
