  Ocean Outcomes is dedicated to the growth of locally-led, independently-supported conservation projects that improve ocean fisheries. The organization grew out of the work of the [Wild Salmon Center's State of the Salmon program](http://thinkshout.com/work/fip-tracker/).

  In announcing the creation of their organization, Ocean Outcomes sought to invest as much of its development budget as possible into design and user experience. They were hesitant to invest in a _heavy_ CMS. However, they did have a need for multilingual content management.
