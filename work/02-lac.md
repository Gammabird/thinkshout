  The Los Angeles Conservancy (LAC) is a nonprofit organization that exists to recognize, preserve, and revitalize the historic architectural and cultural resources of Los Angeles County through education and community engagement. When ThinkShout met the LAC team, they were managing a rapidly-aging website that just didn’t meet their needs any more. They wanted a mobile-friendly, interactive solution that would allow their constituents to easily sign up for walking tours and other events centered around the sites they curated.

    title: Discovery
    column1: |
      The LAC curates hundreds of unique historical sites across Los Angeles and we knew that each, in turn, would need to be highlighted in a way that both excited their constituents and encouraged them to visit the locations.

    title: Strategy
    column1: |
      We worked with outside consultants to introduce the RedHen CRM and Salesforce module to integrate with the site’s Salesforce CRM, and each historical location was treated with its own “microsite,” providing a robust presentation for each point of interest.

    title: Mapping
    column1: |
      Mapping was an integral part of their new design and we knew we needed to knock it out of the park.  Knowing this, we developed Mapbox and Leaflet tools to allow for custom, intelligent mapping throughout the site.

    title: Implementation
    column1: |
      To deliver on the user goals, our team developed a fluid, mobile-friendly site that facilitated education centered around several historical locations, which served as landing platforms for content types like Tours and Architects.
