  Through science and economics, the Environmental Defense Fund's Fisheries Program advocates for seafood preservation and conscientious consumption. A vital component of this program is its Seafood Selector App, a mobile website providing shoppers on-the-go with advice on healthy and eco-friendly seafood options. We worked with their internal development team to redesign the user experience for the Seafood Selector. This couldn't have been a more exciting opportunity for us, given our staff's collective background in environmental conservation.

      In collaboration with EDF staff, we interviewed a sampling of the application's target audience. We then examined website analytics to identify usage patterns and establish performance benchmarks. Finally, we developed _user stories_ to guide the content and information architecture choices for the redesign.

      We developed clickable wireframes that performed beautifully on a variety of mobile and table devices. Our mobile-first approach ensured that users could easily use the tool no matter how they chose to browse, thus giving the EDFâ€™s primary audience a viable tool to use while shopping on the go.

      After creating style tiles and a design guideline, we successfully handed it off to the internal development team and helped reintroduce the Seafood Selector to the world. The result was a highly interactive, easy-to-use chart that informed consumers about the economic impact of their seafood choice as well as the contaminants often found in those fish.
