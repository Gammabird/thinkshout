  A number of our staff worked in environmental conservation before joining the team. So when we met with the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) to talk about seafood preservation, we were all ears. Through science and economics, they advocate for seafood preservation and conscientious consumption, and EDF wanted to reach seafood consumers whether they were at home or the market.  We worked with their internal development team to set about redesigning the user experience for the Seafood Selector, a long-standing consumer advocacy tool. EDF's goal was to help seafood consumers to make informed choices, whether they were at home on their desktop or in the aisle of the grocery store using their smart phone.

      We engaged with EDF staff to interview target audiences for the new web application. We then examined website analytics to identify usage patterns and establish performance benchmarks. Finally, we developed user personas to guide the content and information architecture choices for the redesign.

      We developed clickable wireframes that performed beautifully on a variety of mobile and table devices. Our mobile-first approach ensured that users could easily use the tool no matter how they chose to browse, thus giving the EDFâ€™s primary audience a viable tool to use while shopping on the go.

      After creating style tiles and a design guideline, we successfully handed it off to the internal development team and helped reintroduce the Seafood Selector to the world. The result was a highly interactive, easy-to-use chart that informed consumers about the economic impact of their seafood choice as well as the contaminants often found in those fish.
