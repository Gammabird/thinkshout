client: When the Salmon Project came to ThinkShout, Alaska had no idea who they were. The Salmon Project wasn’t even sure who they were themselves.  That needed to change, and fast. A brand new organization needed help building their identity and shaping the results they wanted to achieve, and that’s exactly what we did for them. We launched their site ahead of schedule, under budget, and with a custom-built kickoff Salmon Love sweepstakes application that had 10,000 participants total in the thirty days it ran. Now they’re telling the stories that need to be told, and teaching Alaskans to love and save their salmon.

      We met with the Salmon Project team to pinpoint what exactly they needed from their new web identity. As this was to be their digital debut, we knew we needed to create something memorable and eye-catching in addition to a solid back-end.

      Using assets from a partnering agency, our UX team focused on delivering an engaging destination that encouraged users to not just look, but explore. Designing in the browser with  mobile-first wireframes was the right call because one third of site traffic during launch week came from mobile users. Through the development of a custom RedHen CRM tool to integrate with the back end of their site, the Salmon Project team was able to cultivate their constituency from day one.
