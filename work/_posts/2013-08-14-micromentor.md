client: MicroMentor was founded by Mercy Corps with the sole purpose of connecting entrepreneurs with the support they need to be successful while simultaneously offering these forward-thinking individuals with opportunities to give back to their community. MicroMentor needed to expand its membership and improve engagement through a fresh redesign. We worked to make their new web space a place for dialogue, encouraging member involvement, streamlining the signup process, and showcasing their successes. The result was a clean, responsive destination that allowed them to do just that.

      While MicroMentor didn’t need a rebrand, it did require a new look designed to appeal to a broader audience. They possessed great resources that would provide their members with exactly what they needed to take their ventures to the next level. ThinkShout just needed to develop a means to drive them to the site and keep them participating.

      ThinkShout teamed up with Dayspring to identify and develop a means to better accomplish MicroMentor’s purpose: to connect entrepreneurs with mentors and facilitate dialogue between them. We overhauled their sign-up system and created a brand new, gorgeous platform for networking that was both visually pleasing and easy to use.
