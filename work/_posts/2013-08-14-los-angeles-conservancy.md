challenge: Save Buildings.
solution: Map craziness.
project_summary: The Conservancy needed to replace an aging site with one that was ready for the modern web and integrated with a new CRM system. With work centered around preserving and promoting hundreds of specific buildings located throughout Los Angeles, they needed a site with integrated mapping that looked great on mobile devices for on-the-ground use. They also wanted to manage and book their walking tours and other events directly through the site, and to create project-specific sub-sites.
