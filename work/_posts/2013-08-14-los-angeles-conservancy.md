oneliner: A modern, mission-driven portal for constituent involvement and engagement.
project_summary: With work centered around preserving and promoting hundreds of specific buildings located throughout Los Angeles, they needed a site with integrated mapping that looked great on mobile devices for on-the-ground use. 
overview: The Conservancy needed to replace an aging site with one that was ready for the modern web and integrated with a new CRM system. With work centered around preserving and promoting hundreds of specific buildings located throughout Los Angeles, they needed a site with integrated mapping that looked great on mobile devices for on-the-ground use. They also wanted to manage and book their walking tours and other events directly through the site, and to create project-specific sub-sites.

ThinkShout worked collaboratively with outside designers and Salesforce CRM consultants chosen by the Conservancy, integrating their work into a beautiful, modern, responsive site with custom-built solutions:

RedHen CRM and the Salesforce module (both ThinkShout-led community projects) integrating the site with Salesforce CRM
ThinkShout-led mobile-first wireframing of a responsive design, ensuring the design team kept mobile in mind
MapBox and Leaflet tools with custom intelligence for integrated mapping throughout, including proximity searching and adaptive map layouts
The Panelizer toolkit implemented as both a simple page-layout tool for site managers and as a framework for easily creating project "Microsites"
Commerce, Registration, and Salesforce tools integrated to allow paid event registrations online and real-time synchronization of registration data with Salesforce
The site presented broad new process implications for the Conservancy, so ThinkShout provided in-depth training and documentation to ensure the site's capabilities could be fully utilized.

ThinkShout led months of discovery on this project's far-reaching scope. Based on that careful work, the site was built with the Locations as the central content type, allowing the sites structure to naturally reflect the organization's programmatic structure: with content types like Issues, Tours, Architects, and Microsites all built with their relationship to Locations central to the design and functionality of the site, just as the purpose of each of these content types is in how they relate to the locations that the Conservancy is trying to preserve, protect, and promote.
