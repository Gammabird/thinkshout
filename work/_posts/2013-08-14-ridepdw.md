client: Portlanders are big fans of bicycles. Not just bicycles, but bicycle paraphernalia, eco-friendly transportation,  and pretty much anything related to that culture. We eat it up. So when we came across Portland Design Works, a Portland leader in bicycle accessories in need of a new website, we leapt at the opportunity. They manufacture beautiful, simple bicycle accessories designed for everyday use and they wanted a website that would reflect the quality of their merchandise. We worked carefully and quickly to deliver exactly that.

      We kept detail and presentation at the forefront of our minds during this process, working to keep the catalog navigable and visually appealing while providing users with all the detailed specifications necessary to make an informed purchase. On the back end, we planned for a Tumblr integration to meet the on-the-go blogging demands of the site maintainers.

      The process involved an Ecommerce migration from Drupal 6 to preserve a long history of customer orders. With a dealer locator built using leaflet, the site provides a mobile-friendly experience for online or in-store shopping.
