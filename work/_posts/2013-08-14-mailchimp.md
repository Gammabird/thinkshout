client: A popular email service we all know and love, MailChimp provides users with fresh, responsive tools to create eye-catching email campaigns. We thought that same robust functionality would really fly in Drupal, so in collaboration with MailChimp, we set out to unite MailChimp and Drupal. The result was the flagship MailChimp Drupal integration module that allowed Drupal-site maintainers to capture emails and organize them with ease. Weâ€™re now working on their exciting e-mail transaction service, Mandrill.

      MailChimp needed to integrate their e-mail service with Drupal and we thought it just made sense to combine these two good-looking, user-friendly platforms. This integration module needed to do more than connect the two. It needed to improve upon the existing system.

      This MailChimp integration module allowed us to introduce several great features to Drupal. The module allows visitors to subscribe to MailChimp during site registration while administrators on the back end can create mail lists, sort the captured data, manage their campaigns, and even track anonymous users.

      ThinkShout introduced this module to the Drupal Community several years ago and continues to maintain it. It works beautifully with our Mandrill module, providing modern analytics, spam compliance features, and a reliable transactional e-mail system.
