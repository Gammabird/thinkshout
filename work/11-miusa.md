client: When we learned about Mobility International USA’s (MIUSA’s) mission, we were eager to get involved. MIUSA works to provide disabled youth with resources and connections for traveling abroad. We built a site that served the needs of their constituency while also alleviating the backend issues that their web team faced in one of the most accessibility-focused projects we’ve undertaken.

  - title: Discovery
    column1: |
      We met with nearly the entire staff of MIUSA in Eugene, Oregon for discovery. It was clear to see early on in the process that site visitor accessibility was paramount to the project, and we needed to ensure that the content was digestible for vision impaired visitors.

  - title: Strategy & Accessibility
    column1: |
      We worked to re-organize the original content of three sites to create one  site, which hosted the massive resource library powered by Apache Solr for a smooth search experience. We used Wave, a Firefox tool, to evaluate each page’s overall accessibility. We invested a lot of time in making sure MIUSA’s resource library worked with screen readers. MIUSA’s accessibility consultant advised us on which contrasting colors would provide the best visibility for visually impaired visitors. Those colors were incorporated into the overall design.

  - title: Implementation
    column1: |
      This project led us to create the Bean Entity View module, which allowed us to place portions of content in different regions on the site. The site’s content is compatible with screen readers and the contrasting color palette we used made the site easily viewable by visitors with impaired vision. To top it off, all of MIUSA’s resources were compiled into a single library housed in one site instead of three.

results: The new MIUSA.org launched in the Spring of 2014 and we are in the process of measuring its success.
