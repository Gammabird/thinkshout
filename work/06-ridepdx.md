  Portlanders are big fans of bicycles. We love our custom saddles, our bamboo fenders, our Italian leather handlebar grips... Seriously, we're a little obsessive when it comes to eco-friendly commuting. So, when Portland Design Works, a long-time client of ThinkShout, reached out to us to reimagine their e-commerce website, we couldn't have been more excited. Portland Design Works manufactures beautiful bicycle accessories designed for everyday use. In describing their goals for the redesign, they wanted a website that reflected the craftsmanship of their merchandise with strong visuals and and an easy-to-use e-commerce checkout process.

      Knowing that Portland Design Works needed to quickly relaunch the new website with support for both mobile and tablet devices, we began the project with a rapid prototyping process. First, we developed a series style tiles that explored a variety of graphic design directions. Then, we build responsive, clickable wireframes using the Foundation prototyping framework.

      The success of this project hinged upon our successful execution of a complex data migration from their Drupal 6 e-commerce website to Drupal 7. Once we completed this upgrade, we were able to take advantage of many new tools available in Drupal 7 to develop new features for the website, including a custom store locator with proximity search, and Tumblr integration for easy blogging.
