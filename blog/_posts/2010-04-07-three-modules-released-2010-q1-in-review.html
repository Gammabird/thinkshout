---

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>As part of ThinkShout's participation in the <a href="http://www.portlandten.com/" target="_blank">Portland 10 Service Company Sprint</a>, we've been talking a lot about our goals as a company for the next 12 months. We also decided to take some time this week for a couple of deep breaths, a few beers, and some reflection on all that we've accomplished in the first quarter of 2010.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the highlights:</p>
<h3>3 Drupal Modules Released on Drupal.org</h3>
<p>Working in collaboration with Lev Tsypin at <a href="http://levelos.com" target="_target">Level OS</a> and a talented developer out of North Carolina named <a href="http://twitter.com/troynt" target="_blank">Troy Thompson</a>, ThinkShout has funded the development of three modules released on Drupal.org:</p>
<p><b><a href="http://drupal.org/project/vs_webform">VoteSmart Webform</a></b> - An add-on module for Webform that allows site administrators to create powerful online petitions that can be sent to local, state and federal officials based upon a zipcode lookup.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://drupal.org/project/mapstraction">Mapstraction</a></b> - While not a new release, working in collaboration with the Lev and the <a href="http://lcrep.org" target="_blank">Lower Columbia Estuary Partnership</a>, we were able to re-engineer this great module to be more stable and to have better Views integration.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://drupal.org/project/qr_codes">QR Codes</a></b> - An admittedly geeky (but really cool) module that allows site admins to create custom 2D bar codes based upon Drupal Token values.</p>
<h3>New Faces at ThinkShout</h3>
<p>In addition to the release of these three modules, we've also had the opportunity to partner with two new developers - Troy Thompson (mentioned above) and front-end engineer <a href="http://www.robertferrero.com/" target="_blank">Robbie Ferrero</a>.</p>
<h3>And of Course, Our Great Clients...</h3>
<p>This quarter we've had the opportunity to work with over ten great nonprofit and small business clients. We've launch four awesome websites and will in the next month will launch another four. I also took some time this quarter to fly out to the East Coast twice to meet up with some of our favorite peeps - such as Mobile Baykeeper, the International Labor Rights Forum, Artomatic, 1Sky and Grand Junction Design.</p>
