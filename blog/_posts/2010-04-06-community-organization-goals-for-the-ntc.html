<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Tomorrow I'll be headed to Atlanta for this year's Nonprofit Technology Conference. I'm looking forward to connecting with other NPO tech nerds. If you're attending as well, connect with me on <a href="http://twitter.com/sean_larkin" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Specifically, I'm excited to talk with both nonprofit decision-makers as well as other developers about how we can work together to build out common Drupal tools for grassroots organizers, as well as help organizations share constituency data via open APIs and more standardized data formats. I'm also interested in connecting with folks doing open source geo-mapping projects, as well as interesting CRM integrations with Drupal. So, if you're headed to Atlanta - give me a shout!</p>
