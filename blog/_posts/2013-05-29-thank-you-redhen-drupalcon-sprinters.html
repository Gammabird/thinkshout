<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Bolstered by Dries's nod to <a href="http://drupal.org/project/redhen">RedHen CRM</a> in his <a href="https://portland2013.drupal.org/keynote/dries-buytaert">keynote address</a>, our RedHen code sprint at DrupalCon last Friday was a great success. This being our first community sprint, the ThinkShout team was happy to collaborate with an awesome group of development partners, including <a href="https://drupal.org/user/77805">Stein Setvik</a> from <a href="http://forumone.com">Forum One</a>, <a href="https://drupal.org/user/941916">Alan Sherry</a> from <a href="http://www.freeflowdigital.com/">Freeflow Digital</a>, <a href="https://drupal.org/user/1017982">Chris Ward</a> from <a href="http://www.moatmedia.com.au/">MoatMedia</a> (in Australia), and <a href="https://drupal.org/user/328914">Jesse Longacre</a>. Together we made progress on three fronts:</p>

<ul>
<li>First, we came up with a development roadmap, user interface, and <a href="http://drupalcode.org/project/redhen.git/shortlog/refs/heads/dedupe">stubbed out code base</a> for a RedHen contact dedupping and merge feature;</li>
<li>Second, we began work on a <a href="https://drupal.org/sandbox/bleedev/2003442">CiviCRM-to-RedHen migration tool</a>;</li>
<li>And finally, we completed an initial release of a <a href="https://drupal.org/project/redhen_feeds">RedHen Feeds module</a> for creating RedHen contacts and organizations.</li>
</ul>

<p>We look to keep this community momentum going into June with the help of these (and many other) partners and friends. In particular, we are focused this next month on completing the dedupping and merge feature and the CiviCRM-to-RedHen migration tool, a as well as continuing to sprint on RedHen community documentation.</p>

<p>Thank you to all those in the community supporting the RedHen initiative!</p>
