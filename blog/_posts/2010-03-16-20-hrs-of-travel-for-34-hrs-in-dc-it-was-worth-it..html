title: 20 hrs of travel for 34 hrs in DC - It was worth it.

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Last night I got back from a whirlwind trip to DC to meet with two of our current clients, as well as two new potential partners.

<p>There's a tempting trend in web technologies to virtualize more and more aspects of the development process. More and more small organizations are considering offshore development shops. Even when working with local services, more and more meetings are happening online and via conferencing services. While more client-to-developer interaction is obviously good, it's easy to forget the value of a good old face-to-face strategy session - followed by a cold beer.</p>
