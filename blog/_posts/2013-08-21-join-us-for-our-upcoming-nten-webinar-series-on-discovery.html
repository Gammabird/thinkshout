<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>At this year's <a href="http://nten.org/ntc">Nonprofit Technology Conference</a>, Brett Meyer and I had the opportunity to present on ThinkShout's discovery process. This session kicked off a number of great follow-up conversations with nonprofit web teams about requirements gathering, prototyping, and project planning. More and more, nonprofits are recognizing the importance of discovery in kicking off their website redesign efforts.</p>

<p>Responding to this interest, we are excited to announce that ThinkShout is partnering with <a href="http://nten.org">NTEN</a> to offer a two-part webinar on requirements gathering and information architecture in early September. Space is limited, so <a href="http://www.nten.org/events/webinar/2013/09/04/webinar-need-a-new-website-wait-have-you-gone-through-a-discovery-process-understanding-target-audi-3">sign up today</a> to join us for this series:</p>

<h2>Need a New Website? Wait! Have You Gone Through a Discovery Process?</h2>

<h3>September 4th, 11-12pm Pacific</h3>

<h4>Understanding Target Audiences, Content, and Features</h4>

<p>Website redesigns can be overwhelming--from selecting a vendor, to budgeting, to managing implementation, to training, to launching and maintaining a new site. It's easy to dive into the technical details and decisions too soon without taking a step back to consider the motivations of your site visitors and your goals for increasing meaningful engagement with your stakeholders.</p>

<p>In this webinar, we outline an effective approach to beginning a website redesign project that is often referred to as “discovery.” Using this thorough discovery process, you can help your organization set the stage for a new website that promotes engagement and focuses your energies and budget on key functionality that truly support your organizational mission.</p>

<p>In this webinar, we will provide participants with a framework and strategies for clearly documenting website redesign goals, identifying target audiences, and envisioning website features that speak to those audiences. This session will culminate with an exercise called "Cores &amp; Paths" that will help participants begin shaping features and content strategy for a website redesign. Join us again for a follow up on September 11 to continue to explore the website discovery process.</p>

<p>Takeaways:</p>

<ol>
<li>How to plan website features that resonate with your organization's stakeholders and target audience</li>
<li>How to manage a website redesign budget and prioritize features</li>
<li>How to work with website vendors and key organizational stakeholders</li>
</ol>

<h3>September 11th, 11-12pm Pacific</h3>

<h4>Information Architecture, Wireframing, and Project Planning</h4>

<p>Website redesigns can be overwhelming–from selecting a vendor, to budgeting, to managing implementation, to training, to launching and maintaining a new site, there's a lot that goes into the redesign process.</p>

<p>It's easy to dive into the technical details and decisions too soon without taking a step back to consider the motivations of your site visitors and your goals for increasing meaningful engagement with your stakeholders. In this webinar, we outline an effective approach to beginning a website redesign project that is often referred to as “discovery”. Using this thorough discovery process, you can help your organization set the stage for a new website that promotes engagement and focuses your energies and budget on key functionality that truly support your organizational mission.</p>

<p>Participants will learn about tools and tips for having a clear approach to developing information architecture and feature specification for a website redesign. Building upon the "Cores &amp; Paths" exercise from the session on September 4, we will teach participants how to iteratively develop key information architecture documents such as a site map and clickable wireframes. From there, we will explain how to turn these assets into an effective RFP document, and more importantly, how to translate this documentation into a successful features specification, budget and project plan.</p>

<p>Takeaways:</p>

<ol>
<li>How to develop an effective site map and clickable wireframes</li>
<li>How to translate these information architecture documents into an effective project plan and development roadmap</li>
<li>How to manage the implementation of a website redesign, using your discovery documentation as a quality assurance tool</li>
</ol>
