title: Watershed Now! released!! (For non-geeks)
---

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Big day for ThinkShout. Just this morning we released the first, pre-alpha version of <a href="http://drupal.org/project/watershednow" target="_blank">Watershed Now!</a>, our free, open source "conservation website in a box" product.</p>
<h2>What is Watershed Now!?</h2>
<p><em>For me personally,</em> Watershed Now! is the culmination of 10 years of fundraising and technology consulting for conservation organizations. <em>Technology-wise,</em> Watershed Now! represents many thousands of hours of open source software development for watershed organizations bundled up into a comprehensive suite of tools to help conservation groups communicate, organize and fundraise.</p>
<p>Now, in <b>one day</b> rather than a full week, ThinkShout can build a highly-functional website with features such as online maps, petition forms, donation pages, and social media integration.</p>
<p>Admittedly, Watershed Now! is not quite ready for public consumption. By the end of the year, our goal is to have the release polished enough that anyone who's ever built a website on a shared hosting account can install and configure a website him/herself in the matter of a few hours. But for now, the product is our bread dough for making awesome online conservation pizzas. Watershed Now! will drop the price point for our entry-level conservation website by 300 percent, while making ThinkShout more profitable and better equipped to invest back into this social venture.</p>
<h2>Coming Soon...</h2>
<p>As a compliment to Watershed Now!, ThinkShout is partnering with <a href="http://waterwordsthatwork.com/" target="_blank">Water Words That Work</a> to put together "website sprints", one-day workshops to help conservation organizations launch beautiful, feature-rich websites with great messaging, copy and imagery <b><em>(in one day!)</em></b>. We're still putting together the program, but stay tuned for a sprint near you - as we're taking this idea on the road.</p>
