<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>ThinkShout is proud to support this year's Pacific Northwest Drupal Summit as a <a href="http://pnwdrupalsummit.org/sponsors">"Silver" sponsor</a>. More importantly, we're proud to have three of our team members presenting on development and project management topics close to our heart.</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning, Lev Tsypin will be presenting on the <a href="http://pnwdrupalsummit.org/sessions/mapping-drupal-7">state of mapping tools in Drupal 7</a>. Lev will describe how folks can move beyond just putting points on a Google Map, with a review the state of the art mapping tools and best practices for telling stories using maps in Drupal. In this session, Lev will also demonstrate a number of Drupal contribute modules that we've developed for Drupal, such as: <a href="http://drupal.org/project/mapstraction">Mapstraction</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/openlayers_taxonomy">OpenLayers Taxonomy</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/openlayers_kml_layer">OpenLayers KML Layer</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/openlayers_field">OpenLayers Field</a>, and our latest: <a href="http://drupal.org/project/leaflet">Leaftlet</a>.</p>
<p>Tomorrow afternoon, I will be co-facilitating a session with <a href="http://pnwdrupalsummit.org/users/billfitzgerald">Bill Fitzgerald</a> on <a href="http://pnwdrupalsummit.org/sessions/drupal-distributions-product-service">"Drupal Distribtions as Product and Service"</a>. Drupal installation profiles and distributions have become the cornerstone of our development workflow - both for productized offerings and for our client work. In this session, we look forward to talking about both our successes and the challenges we've faced in leveraging distribution-based development practices. Likewise, we will provide an inside look into the business of our <a href="http://drupal.org/project/watershednow">"Watershed Now"</a> Drupal Distribution.</p>
<p>Then, on Sunday, Andrea Burton and I will be presenting on the core tool in our project management and development workflow: <a href="http://pnwdrupalsummit.org/sessions/getting-paid-and-adding-greater-value-discovery">"Paid Discovery."</a>Â I couldn't be more excited about this presentation, as we've been heavily focused on crafting our discovery process this year and I think that we've made some huge strides. We just can't wait to roll up our sleeves and share.</p>
<p>So, if you're headed to the Summit this weekend, track us down. We'd love to talk more in-person. And if you don't have a chance to attend our presentations, stay tuned, as we'll be posting the slides next week.</p>
