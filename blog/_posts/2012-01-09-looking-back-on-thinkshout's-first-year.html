<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><div style="font-style:italic; float:left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0; width: 300px;"><img src="http://thinkshout.com/sites/default/files/images/inline/ts_team.jpg" style="width: 300px;" /><br/>The ThinkShout team celebrates our one year anniversary</div>

<p>Almost exactly a year ago, after over a year of flirting with the idea of partnering, Sean and I finally tied the knot. Our initial goals when <a href="http://thinkshout.com/blog/2011/01/lev/levs-take-new-thinkshout-inc">starting ThinkShout</a> were modest:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bring on our first couple of team members.</li>
<li>Expand our the base of amazing non-profits, social ventures, and progressive startups we work with while improving the service we provide to our existing clients.</li>
<li>Expand our expertise in <a href="http://thinkshout.com/expertise#Web-based%20Mapping">mapping</a>, crm/asm, <a href="http://thinkshout.com/expertise#">discovery / strategy</a>, <a href="http://thinkshout.com/expertise#Technology%20Planning">technology planning</a>, <a href="http://thinkshout.com/expertise#Web%20Services%20and%20Integrations">web services / integrations</a>, and, of course, <a href="http://thinkshout.com/expertise#Drupal%20Development">Drupal development</a>.</li>
<li>Participate and contribute to the Drupal community which we're proud to be a part of.</li>
</ul>

<p>We certainly have a long ways to go, but we're proud of how far we've come and are even more excited for what the year ahead holds.

<h2>Highlights</h2>

<ul>

<li>Attending DrupalCon Chicago and <a href="http://2011.badcamp.net/">BADCamp</a> in Berkley, where we presented on pooling resources towards a common goal at the non-profit summit.</li>
<li>Adding Andrea, Brandon, and Tauno to the <a href="http://thinkshout.com/team">ThinkShout team</a>. Seriously, they're all amazing and we couldn't have made it this far without each of them. The year ahead holds so much process as we refine our processes and really come together as a team.</li>
<li>Moving into our new office in the <a href="http://www.ecotrust.org/">EcoTrust</a> building and being part of that dedicated and passionate community.</li>
<li>Launching our sexy new <a href="http://thinkshout.com">responsive website</a>. Great job to everyone involved, especially Andrea who designed it and developed the theme.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Looking ahead to 2012</h2>

<p>I'll avoid a list so that it can't be held over my head :) That said, we're excited to release a native Drupal association management platform, come together as a team to do amazing work, work on exciting new projects while continuing to server our existing clients, add a new developer to the team, contribute more to the Drupal community we're so proud to be a part of, and, most importantly, have a blast while making the world just a smidgen better, one Drupal site at a time.</p>

<p>Hope the new year is filled with promise for everyone. Thanks, the ThinkShout team.</p>
