<p><em>UPDATE: We have a RedHen sprint scheduled for Wednesday May 22nd at 1pm in room A107.</em></p>

<p>The big week is finally here with <a href="http://portland2013.drupal.org/">DrupalCon Portland</a> kicking off in our own backyard. For those of you not familiar with Portland, we're really big into <a href="http://www.putabirdonit.com/">birds</a> (yes, I'm aware that's very 2010), and <a href="http://www.today.com/id/32594370/ns/today-today_home_and_garden/t/portland-ore-urban-chickens-rule-roost/#.UZpiVGRASaN">chickens</a> in particular. I'm working real hard here to make a clever connection to <a href="http://drupal.org/project/redhen">RedHen</a>, the leading native Drupal CRM, and the only one named after a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Red_Hen">bird</a>!</p>

<p>Just in time for the conference, RedHen has a new <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1997676">release</a> with plenty of performance improvements and bug fixes. We have a production site about to launch with over 100k contacts, and our test/development environments are running with over a 100k contacts with thousands of engagements each. We still have lots of work to do, but we're confident in RedHen's ability to scale to "enterprise" levels.</p>

<p>Understandably, one of the most requested features since we launched RedHen as been the ability to import contacts. Our initial pass at meeting that critical need also launched last week in the form <a href="http://drupal.org/project/redhen_feeds">RedHen Feeds</a>, a <a href="http://drupal.org/project/feeds">Feeds</a> processor for RedHen contacts. So get those contacts out of that spreadsheet and into RedHen! Support for organizational affiliations isn't there yet, but is in the works.</p>

<p>ThinkShout will be helping lead a <a href="http://portland2013.drupal.org/program/sprints">RedHen sprint</a> on Friday, May 24th, DrupalCon Portland's official sprint day. So if you're at all native CRM curious, come join our team as we hack away on RedHen and related tools. Learn about large datasets, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/salesforce">Salesforce integration</a>, managing <a href="http://drupal.org/project/redhen_membership">memberships</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/mailchimp">email integration</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/registration">event registrations</a>, and common use cases. Site builders, documentarians, UX specialists, and developers are all welcome.</p>

<p>PS - ThinkShout is co-hosting the <a href="http://pdxdrupaldogooders.eventbrite.com/">Drupal DoGooders Happy Hour</a>, a fundraiser for <a href="http://aaronwinborn.com/blogs/aaron/special-needs-trust">Aaron Winborn</a>, today, Monday May 20th. So please joint us and start your week off right by giving back to someone who has given so much to the Drupal community!</p>
