At DrupalCon Austin, I gave a presentation on [Commerce iATS](https://www.drupal.org/project/commerce_iats), the Drupal module we developed to help you integrate payment processing using iATS Payments into your Drupal site.

[iATS Payments](http://home.iatspayments.com/) have made a huge investment in Drupal and the open source community by sponsoring development of Commerce iATS since April. They even had a presence at DrupalCon and were on-hand to answer developers' questions.

If you couldn't make it to DrupalCon, or you couldn't get into the presentation due to overcrowding, iATS have you covered with an upcoming webinar featuring a new presentation of Commerce iATS. Using the power of the Information Superhighway, you can enjoy this presentation from anywhere in the world.

I'll be covering some of the same material from DrupalCon, including:

- What Commerce iATS is and how it integrates with Drupal
- How you can accept credit card, ACH/EFT and recurring payments
- How you can accept Direct Debit payments for the UK

I'll also be covering these post-DrupalCon developments:

- How you can use Direct Post to securely send payments directly to iATS Payments
- How you can use an encrypted USB card reader to process payments with a credit card

TODO: Details on the webinar (date, how to view, availability, etc)

Before the webinar, you can brush up on iATS Payments at their recently launched [Developer Site](http://home.iatspayments.com/developers).
