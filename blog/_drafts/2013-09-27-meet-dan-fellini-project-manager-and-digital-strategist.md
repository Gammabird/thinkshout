Bringing on new team members is always a big deal at ThinkShout. We're committed to deliberate, sustainable growth as a company, and only the very best of the best job applicants get through the door. This is particularly true for us when it comes to hiring new project managers. As you'd hope to find at all development shops, our project managers must be incredibly detail-oriented. They are directly responsible for making our clients happy, as well a making sure that we complete our projects on time and on budget.

But what's a little bit different at ThinkShout is that our project managers also play a key strategic role in collaborating with our clients. It's not enough for a ThinkShout project manager to manage development tickets, monitor budget spreadsheets, and keep project schedules up to date. Our project managers are strategists. As such, they must have a deep understanding of how web-based tools can be leveraged to help our nonprofit clients manage successful fundraising and advocacy campaigns. We seek out project managers with direct experience working in the nonprofit sector. We look for project managers with solid content strategy experience and a deep understanding of the realities that nonprofits face in managing technology projects with limited budgets.

With this in mind, we could not be happier to introduce our latest addition to the team -- [Dan Fellini](http://thinkshout.com/blog/Dan%20Fellini).

Dan joins us from the One Economy Corporation, a global nonprofit dedicated to helping low income people join the economic mainstream via technology. At One Economy, Dan served as Executive Producer and Vice President of Media, and managed the development of a number of large-scale projects built on open source platforms. The sites that Dan built and managed at One Economy reached hundreds of thousands of people and helped them navigate difficult life circumstances, such as unemployment, disease, housing issues and education. Dan has also worked with the popular NPR show Car Talk as a web developer and social media consultant.

In addition to his professional experience, Dan's just a great guy to have around the office. As a certified ham radio operator and a member of the Portland NET emergency disaster team with advanced medical training, he rounds out our team -- should we ever face a zombie apocalypse here in Portland....
