				<h2>Plenty of Nonprofits, But Not a Single Pirate at BADCamp</h2>
				<p class="meta">29 Oct 2013</p>
				<p><p>When you first hear that you are attending a conference named BADCamp, you can&#39;t help but wonder what kind of conference you are attending. Turns out, BADCamp is actually an awesome introduction into the Drupal community and last weekend I was able to attend my first ever BADCamp.</p>

<p>The Bay Area Drupal Camp (BADCamp), in its 7th year, is a four day collection of summits, trainings, sessions and anything else relating to Drupal. Being that ThinkShout is committed to open source solutions with the nonprofit world, I was happily immersed in the Drupal Nonprofit Summit where nonprofit technologists come together to share their knowledge and experience using open source software.</p>

<p>With many awesome presentations from the teams at the Walter &amp; Elise Haas Fund and TechSoup Global, I have to say that the most memorable presentation for me was given by the East Bay Bicycle Coalition. Max Hunter was able to tell the audience how Drupal changed his organization for the good. The quick backstory was that the EBBC nonprofit website was creating more bad than good to their organization. One of the biggest problems was that the site was not allowing donors to make donations. So yes, big problem. This was in addition to the frustration for site visitors for the overall user experience. EBBC needed help to fix the site once and for all. You could see the presenters relief when he explained his experience working with the Drupal developer who was eager to share his experience with a local nonprofit to remedy the problems and get the site running smoothly. Not only did EBBC’s change to Drupal help their organization’s growth and support, but it ignited the passion of open source.</p>

<p>Throughout the summit, it became more apparent that this was not a unique story. The notion of &quot;giving back&quot; to the community and being an active supporter within nonprofit and Drupal was widespread. The discussions presented at the summit reached all levels of Drupal knowledge in different nonprofit contexts. Whether it be the topic of &#39;Successful Project Redesign&#39; or &#39;Getting Your Organization Drupal Ready&#39;; open source proved to be a very powerful tool for these nonprofits in helping their organizations on the right path for lasting social change.</p>
