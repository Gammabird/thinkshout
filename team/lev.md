With over twelve years of experience in technical architecture, user interface, and module development, Lev is integral to ThinkShout’s development process. It’s the organizations we work with that inspire him to constantly improve on existing practices and the technology in place, making it accessible to those who need it. He previously worked as a consultant with Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) and Inforte Corporation in Chicago and also spent a few years as the Director of Programming at Pop Art, Inc. He holds a bachelors degree in business administration (BBA) and political science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Before ThinkShout, Lev ran the highly-respected consultancy, Level Online Strategy, here in Portland, OR. Now he spends his off hours keeping busy with his two boys.
