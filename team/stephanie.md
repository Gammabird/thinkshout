With a background in nonprofit development, Stephanie knows all too well that keeping your technology up to date and accessible to your constituents isnâ€™t always a priority when dealing with a tight budget. She also has some great tips on how to operate lean while still getting results.  Stephanie has a BA from Gonzaga University and spent a few years in freelance video production and content editing for independent online press. She eventually found herself in the nonprofit world, spearheading a social media campaign and communications plan for Families Forward in Southern California. Through this, Stephanie developed a great appreciation for open source tools that help nonprofits better engage their constituents and she continues to be an advocate for nonprofit technology.
