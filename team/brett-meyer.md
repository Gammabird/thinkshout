Brett thrives off projects that allow him to utilize his skills as a communicator and he loves applying his expertise to the nonprofits that need help marketing their message. His passion for bringing technology to mission-minded organizations eventually brought him to ThinkShout, where he now helps build the applications and sites they need to be agents of change. Before that, Brett served as Communications Director at the Nonprofit Technology Network (NTEN), for six years, helping grow NTEN’s community from a few thousand to over 50,000 engaged participants. Brett has been an active member of the development community since the creation of his first site with an emphasis on project management, user experience, and analytics. He’s also the only person in the office to have worked at a radio station in West Africa.
