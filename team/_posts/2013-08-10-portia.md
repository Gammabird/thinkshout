Working with nonprofits since she was 13, Portia focuses on using open source software to empower local, regional, and national progressive organizations. Portia (pkafei on Drupal.org) has been a part of the open source community for over four years.

Fluent in Mandarin, Portia spent her working hours -- prior to coming to ThinkShout -- building software that parses content from Chinese newspapers.

Portia enjoys attending and presenting at local tech meetups, and is an active member of Pyladies and PDX Django. When she’s not busy sampling espresso in Portland’s many coffee shops, Portia enjoys urban cycling. You will frequently find her biking the rainy streets of Portland.
