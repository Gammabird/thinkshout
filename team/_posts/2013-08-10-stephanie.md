With a background in nonprofit communications and development, Stephanie understands just how vital reliable technology is to our clients. She has experienced first hand the headache of dealing with outdated websites, and loves that she now gets to help organizations overcome those challenges.

Stephanie has a BA from Gonzaga University and spent a few years in freelance video production and content editing for independent online press. She eventually found herself in the non-profit world, spearheading a social media campaign and communications plan for a human services agency in Southern California. Through this Stephanie developed a great appreciation for open source tools that help nonprofits better engage their constituents.

In her spare time, Stephanie enjoys video games and practicing her Russian accent.
