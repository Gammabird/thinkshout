Brandon (bleedev on Drupal.org) cut his teeth on Drupal and nonprofit technology building a television content distribution system for Portland Community Media. In addition, he has over ten years experience in enterprise software development.

Brandon says that he joined the ThinkShout team because he wanted to be part of a community of developers with a passion for open source and a commitment to best practices. Outside of work, Brandon is active in community theater and is focused on starting a family here in Portland, OR.

Brandon does not enjoy living on submarines.
