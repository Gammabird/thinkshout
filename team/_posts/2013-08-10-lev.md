Lev Tsypin (levelos on Drupal.org) has over 12 years of experience leading technology projects and is a technical architect and co-owner of ThinkShout, Inc. where he leads technical design, user interface and module development. Prior to ThinkShout, Lev ran the highly-respected consultancy, Level Online Strategy, here in Portland, OR.

In the 1990's he worked as a consultant with Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) and Inforte Corporation in Chicago. Before starting Level OS, he served as the Director of Programming at Pop Art, Inc. He holds a bachelors degree in business administration (BBA) and political science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

When not working to help organizations through technology, Lev likes to take advantage of the areas they protect, be it on foot, skis, or bike. At least when he's not wrapped up with his 2 boys, which isn't very often these days!
