  Brandon’s never been a big fan of submarines. We don’t know why, but we do know that he comes to us with an extensive background in Drupal development, web development in general, and a commitment to putting his skills to use for worthwhile organizations. That’s what matters most, right?

Brandon joined the ThinkShout team in an effort to be part of a community of developers with a passion for open source technology and a dedication to best practices. He brings ten years of experience in enterprise software development to the team and we’re excited to have him on our roster. Prior to joining ThinkShout, Brandon was building a television content distribution system for Portland Community Media. Now that Brandon is good and settled here in Portland, he’s focusing on raising a family with his wife. He considers himself a full-time dad.
