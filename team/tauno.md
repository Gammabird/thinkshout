Tauno has the technical knowledge and genuine passion for nonprofits that we look for in a ThinkShout team leader. Naturally, he fits right in here. He sets the bar high and tackles each new challenge with positivity and a thoughtfulness thatâ€™s downright contagious. Prior to ThinkShout, Tauno worked at the University of Oregon, where he contributed to the development of a complex Drupal-based online learning platform for language teachers. He holds a degree in Natural Resources Planning & Interpretation and continues to pursue his passion for the outdoors by spending a great deal of his free time neck-deep in nature.
