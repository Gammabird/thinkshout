Claire puts the “management” in project management and lives to perfect systems while maximizing efficiency. Her active involvement in the Portland nonprofit sector brought her to ThinkShout, where she could help provide progressive organizations with sustainable technology. Prior to joining us, Claire implemented and project managed speciality coffee programs for national private label companies throughout the country at Coffee Bean International. A Portland native, she received her Project Management Certificate at Portland State University and has a BA in Education from the University of Oregon. We have an immense respect for her extensive knowledge of all things coffee-related.
