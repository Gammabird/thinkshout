Brett built his first website in 1996 and has been actively involved in Internet development ever since, with particular focus on project management, user experience, and analytics. A stint in the Peace Corps, working at a radio station in rural West Africa, brought him into the nonprofit world. Prior to ThinkShout, Brett spent 6 years at the Nonprofit Technology Network (NTEN), serving as its Communications Director; while there, he helped NTEN grow its community from a few thousand to more than 50,000 participants and found a calling in helping cause-driven organizations use technology to better meet their missions.

Outside of work, Brett spends more time than he'd care to admit playing and watching soccer, but he does find time to cook several times a week and to escape on backpacking trips with his wife Melissa, where they work on their photography portfolios. He's also an excellent source for beer or restaurant recommendations in the Portland area.
