  After fifteen years of developing websites for mission-minded organizations, David has developed what we think is a pretty excellent background with our clientele. He understands open source software and the organizations we serve. He also throws a mean boomerang, so we try not to make him mad.

A graduate of West Texas A&M University, David most recently worked to develop seamless eCommerce integration for distinct Drupal 7 and Drupal 6 sites for AllPlayers.com, a provider of technology to more than 100,000 national and local community users. Prior to that, he served as the Director of Web Development at Blue Tent Marketing, where he refined the best practices of their internal development team. David continues to be committed to open source and strives to develop sustainable websites for our nonprofit clients. When he’s not busy coding, he’s learning how to play the cello or throwing a boomerang.
