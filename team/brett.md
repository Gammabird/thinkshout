Prior to joining ThinkShout, Brett was a Production Director at Wardenclyffe, a design and development agency based in New York. Brett worked with clients on high-end fashion and entertainment brands, and his appreciation for mission-based organizations finally led him to ThinkShout.  Here, he gets to utilize his skills for worthy causes, bringing that same high-fashion standard of excellence to our clients. Brett also previously worked at OpenSourcery, a Portland-based web development firm, as a User Experience Developer. After taking off for the day, you’ll often find Brett playing guitar, spending time with his family and two dogs, Gus and Waylon, or building things out of wood.
